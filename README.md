# Water Jar Management System

## Overview

The **Water Jar Management System** is a web-based application designed to efficiently manage the delivery of water jars to customers. It streamlines the process for customers, delivery personnel, and administrators. By using this system, water delivery companies can easily manage customer orders, track delivery statuses, and ensure smooth operations.
